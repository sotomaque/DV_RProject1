How does the price of bording passes sold for the Titanic correlate to suvival outcomes?

**The Titanic sunk on April 15, 1912 along with over 1,500 men, women, and children.**
<br></br>
In order to create this visualization, age and fare are used as measures, and the color of each point plot is determined by the sex of the corresponding passanger.

<br></br>
This plot is very similar to the previous one, except only male and female genders are plotted. This is done by specifying in SQL "select * from titanic where gender is not null"
<br></br>

<br></br>
Males were slighly less likely to survive, as lifeboats were scarece and seats were reserved for women and chlidren.
